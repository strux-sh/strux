# Changelog

## v0.0.16
This version of Strux disables the Strux WPE Inspector by default on new Strux projects. This prevents the issue that keeps resurging (#5).

If you haven't already on an older project, you'll need to add the following to your `strux.yaml`:

```yaml
dev:
    inspector:
        enabled: false
        port: 9223
```
